                Rapid prototyped an isometric tactics game set in an office setting. After a successful pitch,
                I went on to lead that team as producer the next semester. My tasks included organizing meetings,
                prioritizing tasks, ensuring team cohesion, as well as general programming and design work.

                Implemented a robust node based dialogue system using Unity's GraphView API. Followed a lengthy tutorial series to get the initial set-up, then iterated, adding features such as a front-end, more data elements, and event functionality.

            Created a prototype for a fantasy city builder with RPG elements. Pitched that prototype into semester long production cycle where I served as creative director. My tasks included design documentation, project management, as well as some systems programming.
