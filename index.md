	<h2>Welcome to My Blog!</h2>
	<p><em>Date 9/26/24</em></p>
	<p>This is the website I will be using for my biweekly devlogs for my work this semester at WolverineSoft. Here you can find detailed breakdowns of my tasks and workload, you can also find relevant links to my social media and contact information. Each blog will feature a deep, personal look into my thoughts and development process. They will also contain images of finished work and hour breakdowns which show how much I have worked on in a given week and what it was on. Thank you for taking the time to read through it and I hope you enjoy!</p>
