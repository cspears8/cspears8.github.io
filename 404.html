        <p>You've discovered one of my hobby projects! This is a Gameboy game made purely in SM83 assembly. I picked this up due to a combined interest in retro gaming and low level programming. I wanted to get a better understanding of the limits that game developers had back in the 90s, and after working on this for a bit it's a miracle that they made anything at all! Happy tinkering!</p>
