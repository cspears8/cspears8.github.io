			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I'm a systems programmer and technical designer, currently based in Ypsilanti, MI. I obtained my BS in Computer Science from Eastern Michigan University in December 2024, where I fell in love with the art of game development. Currently, I am obtaining my MA from Michigan State University where I study game development. I also teach special needs students about game development at my part-time job.</p>
			<p>I've worn a lot of hats over my 5+ years of game dev, including design, programming, and project management roles. I develop at this point purely for the love of the process of making a game, from the highs of seeing peoples' smiles while playing my game, to the lows of the late night memory leak bug fixes.</p>
			<p>When I need a break from making games I enjoy playing single-player games, especially RPGs. My favorite games are Chrono Trigger, Gris, and BioShock. Other than games I am a huge music fan, some of my favorite genres are Psychedelic Rock, Hardcore Punk, and Jazz Rap.</p>
