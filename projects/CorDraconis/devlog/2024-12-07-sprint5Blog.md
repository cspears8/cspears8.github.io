## Introduction

With development being finished up (for the most part), we now had to focus our attention on creating our documentation. We needed a game design document, art design document, audio design document, and a programming design document. Afterwords we had to showcase our project at the UM/EMU Games Showcase, and create as well as deliver our pitch deck during our last meeting.

## Week One

### Discord Meeting #7 (30min)
We had a quick meeting do discuss what we needed to do on the documentation side, as well as check-in on if the game needed anything else before we pause development. I took notes on what was needed with a play test, other than a couple quick fix bugs and minor pieces of art/sound implementation, we were basically done with development. We mentioned that the game should be rebalanced before the showcase so that the game is more playable, that will be fixed later. When it came to documentation assignment, obviously Nadav would handle the art design doc, while I would largely handle the game design doc, and Gavin would handle the programming design doc as well as the audio design doc. Our next steps were laid out, time to get to work!

### Game Design Document (6hr)
I spent an entire day drafting up our game design document, from the story and characters to the controls to the UI assets. This was all written in a well-organized Notion document which will be shared with the rest of the group at the next meeting. I had to consider a lot of things we haven't considered as a team since we have been mostly focused on functionality. Those including character designs (personalities, functions), story outlines (story arc and enemy design), and the audience for our game. Here is some examples of how it looks!
